# About me
Hi there! I'm Ysterklou2005, but just call me Ysterklou.
I'm interested in game development, specificly indie game development. As I'm currently part of an indie game development group called, Jurubu Entertainment. Currently I'm learning Gdscript in Godot, and now, I more or less know what I'm doing.

# Collaboration
Currently I'm not looking to collaborate on a project. But I may consider it. Just don't spam me with collab requests. Also don't spam me on gmail and discord.
